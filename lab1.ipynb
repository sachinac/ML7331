    "Our selected dataset is a labeled collection of inpatient medical claims, non-personally identifiable beneficiary data, and a list of providers who have been suspected as filing fraudulent claims.  Detecting fraudulent claims is a request frequently asked by a great many organizations in the healthcare industry (and especially in insurance), and claim data is readily available at many of these organizations, so it stands to reason that we may be able to predict fraudulent behavior by analyzing a large number of medical claims.  We will analyze over 40,000 medical claims, non-personally identifying beneficiary information and provider IDs who have previously been identified as engaging in suspected fraudulent behavior in order to attempt to predict possible fraudulent behavior in new claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have a categorical response variable, we'll need to treat this as a classification problem.  We will predict possible fraudulent claims and measure effectiveness using cross validation and focus on attaining high metrics in precision and recall.  Precision measures the percentage of fraudulent predictions which are truly fraudulent, and recall measures the total percentage of fraudulent claims correctly identified.  These two metrics have been identified as most appropriate, due to our objective of correctly identifying fraudulent claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential outcomes of using this dataset are potentially improving viability of existing provider fraud detection mechanisms in insurance and member paid claims.  Knowledge of fraudulent or excessive billed services awareness for what is or is not acceptable can save money and help reduce rising healthcare costs due to rising insurance premiums."
